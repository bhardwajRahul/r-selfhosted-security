# Contributing

Contributors are welcomed! You can contribute in a number of ways.



## 1. Suggesting edits or inclusions through an issue

Navigate to the issue tab and make your suggestion. I'll respond accordingly! :)


## 2. Pull requests

Feel free to make a pull request and I'll review it.


## 3. Become a contributor

You're free to **request** contributor access, but I won't give direct push permissions to just everyone as it'll give you the right to just simply overwrite anything.

You can become a contributor if you can provide proof of knowledge, and if I feel you're trustworthy enough.

I'm looking at investing quite some time at building and expanding these guides, so trust is an essential component in this.


## 4. Subrepo's

Have you built your own guide and do you feel it would be great to include it here as well? Great! I can link it as a subrepo.

This is a decent solution if you've made something of your own and want to keep full-access rights to it.

I reserve the right to revoke any previously given permission regarding contributing at any time for any given reason.
