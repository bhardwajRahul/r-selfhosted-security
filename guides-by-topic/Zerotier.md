# Zerotier


## Introduction

Zerotier is a self-hostable product that allows users to create either self-hosted or Zerotier-hosted private networks.

Zerotier supports a vide variety of devices and offers both L2 and L3 connectivity.

To translate: L3 or Layer 3 networking is routed networking, like WireGuard does. The main limitation on this is the lack of broadcast traffic on the VPN which is a limitation for a fair set of home apps.

Zerotier is therefor unique in their offering of L2 support, which _does_ support said traffic.
